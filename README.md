you shouldnt be here

## what is this

its not a game. games have endings. this doesnt end. the corridors keep generating. ive been walking for three hours and the coordinates just keep changing. x y z. depth increasing. the fluorescent lights hum at frequencies that shouldnt exist.

the walls are the color of old manila folders. the carpet is damp. it absorbs sound in a way that feels intentional. you cant hear your own footsteps after a while. just the lights. always the lights.

## how do i leave

you dont. theres no exit. there is only further.

type commands into the terminal. `look`. `examine`. `go north`. `go deeper`. the room descriptions change but theyre all the same. have you noticed that? theyre all the same room. youve been here before. you keep coming back to the same coordinates but the room is different. how is the room different if the coordinates are the same.

## features (if you can call them that)

- infinite procedural generation (it never stops generating)
- depth system (you can go down forever. have you tried going back up? you cant go back up)
- terminal interface (like the old systems. the ones that werent supposed to be accessible)
- ascii manifestations (sometimes things appear in the rooms. geometric shapes. they watch)
- coordinate tracking (x y z. the numbers dont make sense after depth 50)
- whisper system (do you see the text in the corner? those arent bugs)

## installation

```bash
# clone this
git clone https://github.com/eliminations/lost.git

# you dont need to install anything
# just open index.html
# but once you open it you have to keep going

# or dont. maybe its better if you dont.
```

## tech

vanilla js. no frameworks. no dependencies except the void. html css js. thats it. simple. too simple? the simplicity is intentional. or maybe it isnt. maybe i just dont know what im doing and the architecture emerged on its own.

## the experience

you start in a corridor. walls manila. carpet damp. lights humming. you can go north south east west. you can go deeper. level 1 becomes level 2 becomes level 50 becomes level 200. the descriptions get stranger. the manifestations more frequent. have you seen the corner eye? it blinks.

sometimes the rooms have tables. sometimes chairs facing wrong directions. sometimes nothing at all just carpet and walls and the feeling that something was here before you arrived.

## coordinates

the game tracks xyz coordinates and depth. but the math is wrong. you go north five times then south five times and youre not where you started. the coordinates lie. or maybe youre moving through space that doesnt follow euclidean rules. maybe youve always been moving through that kind of space and youve only just now noticed.

## commands

type anything. `look` `examine table` `go north` `deeper` `back` (back doesnt work. it never works. there is no back)

the parser is primitive. it looks for keywords. north. south. deeper. examine. sometimes it understands. sometimes it pretends to understand. can you tell the difference?

## sounds

theres no sound in the game but you hear it anyway. the hum. the static. the sound of damp carpet absorbing your presence. the lights buzz at 60hz but you hear harmonics that shouldnt exist. close the tab and you still hear them for a few minutes. is that tinnitus or something else.

## warnings

- dont play this for too long
- the depth counter is not decorative
- if you reach depth 100 stop
- the manifestations are procedural but some of them repeat
- if you see the same ascii shape three times in a row close the tab
- the coordinates are real coordinates but not to anywhere you can reach

## is this horror?

no. horror implies fear. this is just architecture. infinite architecture. liminal architecture. the backrooms but procedural. have you heard of the backrooms? this is level 1. there is no level 0. you cant go back to level 0. there is only further.

## actually what is this really

an experiment in procedural liminal space generation. web based interactive fiction. explore infinitely generating rooms. atmospheric descriptions. crt aesthetic. terminal interface. inspired by the backrooms, house of leaves, control, antichamber, that feeling you get in empty office buildings at 3am.

## contributing

you can submit prs but why would you want to make this bigger. its already infinite. what more could you add to infinity.

## license

do whatever you want with it. take it. clone it. modify it. make it worse. the code is yours. the architecture is not. the architecture belongs to itself.

built with claude. the ai helped but the weird parts are mine. or maybe the weird parts are the ais. can you tell the difference.
